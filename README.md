# 👋Hey, I'm Elbby

I'm a data scientist with over 5 years of experience, which sounds serious, but I promise I’m fun (and funny)! 

🌟 I’ve spent time at Solocal and Renault Digital, building, optimizing, and deploying ML models and playing around with big data on Google Cloud Platform. I’m also an MLOps enthusiast—yes, I know, it sounds intense, but really, it just means I love making pipelines behave. On the side, I’m a YouTuber, sharing my journey through data, self-determination, and fitness. Right now, I’m all about exploring how LLMs and AI-driven tools can make life more efficient—and more fun.
